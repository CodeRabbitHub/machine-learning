    "## t-Distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding (t-SNE)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "t-Distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding (t-SNE) is a nonlinear dimensionality reduction technique primarily used for visualizing high-dimensional data in 2 or 3 dimensions. It is particularly effective at preserving local structure and revealing clusters in data.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Mathematical Foundations\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1. **Pairwise Similarities in High Dimension**\n",
    "\n",
    "Compute pairwise similarities between data points in the high-dimensional space using a Gaussian distribution.\n",
    "\n",
    "Given a dataset $ X $ with $ n $ samples and $ p $ features, the similarity between two points $ x_i $ and $ x_j $ is defined as:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ p_{j|i} = \\frac{\\exp(-\\| x_i - x_j \\|^2 / 2 \\sigma_i^2)}{\\sum_{k \\neq i} \\exp(-\\| x_i - x_k \\|^2 / 2 \\sigma_i^2)} $$\n",
    "\n",
    "The joint probabilities are then symmetrized:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ p_{ij} = \\frac{p_{j|i} + p_{i|j}}{2n} $$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $ \\sigma_i $ is the variance of the Gaussian centered at $ x_i $.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 2. **Pairwise Similarities in Low Dimension**\n",
    "\n",
    "Compute pairwise similarities between data points in the low-dimensional space using a Student's t-distribution with one degree of freedom (which is equivalent to a Cauchy distribution).\n",
    "\n",
    "For low-dimensional points $ y_i $ and $ y_j $:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ q_{ij} = \\frac{(1 + \\| y_i - y_j \\|^2)^{-1}}{\\sum_{k \\neq l} (1 + \\| y_k - y_l \\|^2)^{-1}} $$\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 3. **Minimizing the Kullback-Leibler Divergence**\n",
    "\n",
    "Minimize the Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence between the joint probabilities $ P $ and $ Q $ to ensure that the low-dimensional representation $ Y $ preserves the high-dimensional similarities.\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ KL(P || Q) = \\sum_{i \\neq j} p_{ij} \\log \\frac{p_{ij}}{q_{ij}} $$\n",
    "\n",
    "This is achieved through gradient descent optimization:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ \\frac{\\partial C}{\\partial y_i} = 4 \\sum_{j \\neq i} \\left( p_{ij} - q_{ij} \\right) \\left( y_i - y_j \\right) \\left( 1 + \\| y_i - y_j \\|^2 \\right)^{-1} $$\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example\n",
    "\n",
    "Consider a dataset with three clusters in a high-dimensional space. t-SNE can reveal these clusters in 2D.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Compute Pairwise Similarities in High Dimension**\n",
    "\n",
    "    Calculate $ p_{ij} $ using the Gaussian distribution for all pairs of data points.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Initialize Low-dimensional Representation**\n",
    "\n",
    "    Initialize $ y_i $ randomly or using PCA.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Compute Pairwise Similarities in Low Dimension**\n",
    "\n",
    "    Calculate $ q_{ij} $ using the Student's t-distribution for all pairs of low-dimensional points.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Minimize KL Divergence**\n",
    "\n",
    "    Use gradient descent to iteratively update $ y_i $ and minimize the KL divergence.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Result**\n",
    "\n",
    "    Visualize the 2D representation, revealing the clusters.\n",
    "\n",
    "### When to Use t-SNE\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Data visualization**: t-SNE is particularly useful for visualizing high-dimensional data in 2D or 3D.\n",
    "- **Exploratory data analysis**: Helps in identifying patterns, clusters, and outliers in the data.\n",
    "- **Preprocessing**: Can be used as a preprocessing step to reduce dimensions before applying other algorithms.\n",
    "\n",
    "### How to Use t-SNE\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Standardize the data** if necessary.\n",
    "2. **Set hyperparameters** such as perplexity (typically between 5 and 50), learning rate, and number of iterations.\n",
    "3. **Compute pairwise similarities** in high-dimensional space.\n",
    "4. **Initialize low-dimensional points**.\n",
    "5. **Run gradient descent** to minimize KL divergence.\n",
    "6. **Visualize the low-dimensional data**.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Advantages\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Effective visualization**: Reveals complex patterns and clusters that may not be visible in high-dimensional space.\n",
    "- **Nonlinear relationships**: Captures nonlinear relationships between data points.\n",
    "- **Local structure preservation**: Preserves the local structure of the data well.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Disadvantages\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Computationally intensive**: Slow for very large datasets due to pairwise similarity computations.\n",
    "- **Parameter sensitivity**: Results can be sensitive to hyperparameters like perplexity and learning rate.\n",
    "- **Non-deterministic**: Different runs can yield different results due to random initialization.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Assumptions\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Locality preservation**: Assumes that similar points in high-dimensional space remain similar in low-dimensional space.\n",
    "- **Non-linear transformation**: Suitable for datasets where linear methods like PCA fail to capture complex relationships.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "t-SNE is a powerful tool for dimensionality reduction, especially for visualizing high-dimensional data. By focusing on preserving local structures and minimizing the KL divergence between high and low-dimensional spaces, t-SNE effectively reveals clusters and patterns that may be hidden in the original high-dimensional space. Despite its computational demands and sensitivity to parameters, t-SNE remains a popular choice for exploratory data analysis and visualization."
