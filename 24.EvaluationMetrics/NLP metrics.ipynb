    "### 1. BLEU Score\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Definition:\n",
    "BLEU (Bilingual Evaluation Understudy) Score is a metric commonly used to evaluate the quality of machine-generated translations by comparing them to one or more reference translations. BLEU measures the overlap between the candidate translation and the reference translations based on n-gram precision.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Formula:\n",
    "BLEU Score is calculated based on the precision of n-grams in the candidate translation compared to one or more reference translations.\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\text{BLEU} = \\text{BP} \\times \\exp\\left(\\sum_{n=1}^{N} w_n \\cdot \\log(p_n)\\right)\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Where:\n",
    "- $ \\text{BP} $ is the Brevity Penalty.\n",
    "- $ p_n $ is the precision for n-grams.\n",
    "- $ w_n $ is the weight assigned to the precision of n-grams.\n",
    "- $ N $ is the maximum n-gram order considered.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Use Cases:\n",
    "- Evaluating the performance of machine translation systems.\n",
    "- Assessing the quality of text summarization algorithms.\n",
    "- Comparing the output of language generation models.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Advantages:\n",
    "- Provides a quantitative measure of translation quality.\n",
    "- Simple to compute and interpret.\n",
    "- Widely used and accepted in the machine translation community.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Disadvantages:\n",
    "- Insensitive to meaning and semantics, as it primarily focuses on lexical overlap.\n",
    "- Favors shorter translations due to the brevity penalty.\n",
    "- Limited in assessing fluency and coherence.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Purpose:\n",
    "The BLEU Score serves as a valuable tool for researchers and practitioners in assessing the effectiveness of machine translation systems.

    "\n",
    "#### Definition:\n",
    "ROUGE (Recall-Oriented Understudy for Gisting Evaluation) Score is a set of metrics used to evaluate the quality of summaries generated by automatic summarization systems. ROUGE measures the overlap between the candidate summary and one or more reference summaries at multiple levels, including n-gram overlap and sequence overlap.\n",

    "#### Disadvantages:\n",
    "- Similar to BLEU, ROUGE is primarily based on lexical overlap and may not capture semantic similarity effectively.\n",
    "- Requires reference summaries for evaluation, which may be time-consuming or costly to obtain.\n",
    "- Sensitivity to small changes in the output due to the use of exact matching.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Purpose:\n",
    "The ROUGE Score is essential for researchers and developers working on automatic summarization systems. By quantifying the similarity between generated summaries and reference summaries, ROUGE helps assess the effectiveness and performance of summarization algorithms.\n",
