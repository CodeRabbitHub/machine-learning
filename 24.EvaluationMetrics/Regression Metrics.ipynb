    "### Regression Metrics: Detailed Explanation\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1. Mean Absolute Error (MAE)\n",
    "- **Definition**: MAE measures the average magnitude of the errors in a set of predictions, without considering their direction. It is the average over the test sample of the absolute differences between prediction and actual observation where all individual differences have equal weight.\n",
    "  \n",
    "  $$\n",
    "  MAE = \\frac{1}{n} \\sum_{i=1}^{n} | y_i - \\hat{y}_i |\n",
    "  $$\n",
    "  \n",
    "- **When to Use**: MAE is useful when you want a straightforward measure of the average error without considering the direction of the errors.\n",
    "- **Advantages**: Easy to understand and interpret; not sensitive to outliers.\n",
    "- **Disadvantages**: Does not penalize larger errors more than smaller errors.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 2. Mean Squared Error (MSE)\n",
    "- **Definition**: MSE measures the average of the squares of the errors. It's the mean of the square of the difference between actual and predicted values.\n",
    "  \n",
    "  $$\n",
    "  MSE = \\frac{1}{n} \\sum_{i=1}^{n} (y_i - \\hat{y}_i)^2\n",
    "  $$\n",
    "  \n",
    "- **When to Use**: Use MSE when larger errors need to be penalized more than smaller ones.\n",
    "- **Advantages**: Penalizes larger errors more than smaller errors, useful for gradient-based optimization methods.\n",
    "- **Disadvantages**: Sensitive to outliers because errors are squared.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 3. Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)\n",
    "- **Definition**: RMSE is the square root of the MSE. It measures the standard deviation of the residuals (prediction errors).\n",
    "  \n",
    "  $$\n",
    "  RMSE = \\sqrt{\\frac{1}{n} \\sum_{i=1}^{n} (y_i - \\hat{y}_i)^2}\n",
    "  $$\n",
    "  \n",
    "- **When to Use**: Use RMSE when you need an error metric that has the same units as the output variable.\n",
    "- **Advantages**: Similar to MSE but easier to interpret due to the same units as the target variable.\n",
    "- **Disadvantages**: Still sensitive to outliers like MSE.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 4. R-squared (R²)\n",
    "- **Definition**: R² measures the proportion of the variance in the dependent variable that is predictable from the independent variables.\n",
    "  \n",
    "  $$\n",
    "  R^2 = 1 - \\frac{\\sum_{i=1}^{n} (y_i - \\hat{y}_i)^2}{\\sum_{i=1}^{n} (y_i - \\bar{y})^2}\n",
    "  $$\n",
    "  \n",
    "- **When to Use**: Use R² to determine how well the model explains the variability of the response data around its mean.\n",
    "- **Advantages**: Provides a measure of how well observed outcomes are replicated by the model.\n",
    "- **Disadvantages**: Can be misleading for non-linear models or when comparing models with different numbers of predictors.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 5. Adjusted R-squared\n",
    "- **Definition**: Adjusted R² adjusts the R² value based on the number of predictors in the model. It accounts for the number of predictors and adjusts for the degrees of freedom.\n",
    "  \n",
    "  $$\n",
    "  \\text{Adjusted } R^2 = 1 - \\frac{(1-R^2)(n-1)}{n-p-1}\n",
    "  $$\n",
    "  \n",
    "- **When to Use**: Use Adjusted R² to compare models with different numbers of predictors.\n",
    "- **Advantages**: Provides a more accurate measure than R² when comparing models with a different number of predictors.\n",
    "- **Disadvantages**: More complex to calculate and interpret than R².\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 6. Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE)\n",
    "- **Definition**: MAPE measures the average absolute percentage error of predictions.\n",
    "  \n",
    "  $$\n",
    "  MAPE = \\frac{1}{n} \\sum_{i=1}^{n} \\left| \\frac{y_i - \\hat{y}_i}{y_i} \\right|\n",
    "  $$\n",
    "  \n",
    "- **When to Use**: Use MAPE when you need a percentage error metric.\n",
    "- **Advantages**: Easy to interpret as a percentage.\n",
    "- **Disadvantages**: Can be biased towards predictions that are too high or too low; undefined when actual values are zero.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 7. Mean Bias Deviation (MBD)\n",
    "- **Definition**: MBD measures the average bias in predictions.\n",
    "  \n",
    "  $$\n",
    "  MBD = \\frac{1}{n} \\sum_{i=1}^{n} (y_i - \\hat{y}_i)\n",
    "  $$\n",
    "  \n",
    "- **When to Use**: Use MBD to understand if your model is biased towards overestimating or underestimating.\n",
    "- **Advantages**: Simple to calculate; indicates overall bias direction.\n",
    "- **Disadvantages**: Does not provide information on the magnitude of errors.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 8. Mean Absolute Scaled Error (MASE)\n",
    "- **Definition**: MASE measures the relative accuracy of predictions by comparing the mean absolute error to the mean absolute error of a naive model.\n",
    "  \n",
    "  $$\n",
    "  MASE = \\frac{\\frac{1}{n} \\sum_{i=1}^{n} | y_i - \\hat{y}_i |}{\\frac{1}{n-1} \\sum_{i=2}^{n} | y_i - y_{i-1} |}\n",
    "  $$\n",
    "  \n",
    "- **When to Use**: Use MASE for comparing the accuracy of forecasts with different scales.\n",
    "- **Advantages**: Scale-independent; useful for comparing across different datasets.\n",
    "- **Disadvantages**: Requires a naive benchmark model for comparison.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 9. Symmetric Mean Absolute Percentage Error (SMAPE)\n",
    "- **Definition**: SMAPE measures the accuracy of predictions in percentage terms and is a symmetric version of MAPE.\n",
    "  \n",
    "  $$\n",
    "  SMAPE = \\frac{100\\%}{n} \\sum_{i=1}^{n} \\frac{| y_i - \\hat{y}_i |}{(| y_i | + | \\hat{y}_i |)/2}\n",
    "  $$\n",
    "  \n",
    "- **When to Use**: Use SMAPE for a more balanced measure of percentage error.\n",
    "- **Advantages**: Symmetric; less biased than MAPE.\n",
    "- **Disadvantages**: Can still be undefined if both actual and predicted values are zero.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 10. Median Absolute Error\n",
    "- **Definition**: Median Absolute Error is the median of all absolute differences between predicted and actual values.\n",
    "  \n",
    "  $$\n",
    "  \\text{Median Absolute Error} = \\text{median}(| y_i - \\hat{y}_i |)\n",
    "  $$\n",
    "  \n",
    "- **When to Use**: Use this when you want a robust measure against outliers.\n",
    "- **Advantages**: Less sensitive to outliers compared to MAE.\n",
    "- **Disadvantages**: May not be as intuitive as mean-based measures.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 11. Mean Squared Logarithmic Error (MSLE)\n",
    "- **Definition**: MSLE measures the mean of the squares of the logarithmic differences between actual and predicted values.\n",
    "  \n",
    "  $$\n",
    "  MSLE = \\frac{1}{n} \\sum_{i=1}^{n} (\\log(1 + y_i) - \\log(1 + \\hat{y}_i))^2\n",
    "  $$\n",
    "  \n",
    "- **When to Use**: Use MSLE when you want to penalize underestimation more than overestimation.\n",
    "- **Advantages**: Less sensitive to large errors; useful when the target variable has exponential growth.\n",
    "- **Disadvantages**: Less interpretable than MSE.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 12. Root Mean Squared Logarithmic Error (RMSLE)\n",
    "- **Definition**: RMSLE is the square root of MSLE.\n",
    "  \n",
    "  $$\n",
    "  RMSLE = \\sqrt{\\frac{1}{n} \\sum_{i=1}^{n} (\\log(1 + y_i) - \\log(1 + \\hat{y}_i))^2}\n",
    "  $$\n",
    "  \n",
    "- **When to Use**: Use RMSLE for a similar purpose as MSLE, but when you prefer the error metric to have the same unit as the target variable.\n",
    "- **Advantages**: Easier to interpret than MSLE; penalizes underestimation more.\n",
    "- **Disadvantages**: More complex to compute than RMSE."
